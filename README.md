Python Projects

Some ideas for the project have come from "Complete Python 3 Bootcamp Master" course on Udemy by Jose Portilla

Each file may contain multiple challenges within a category (category is designated by the file name)

"INCOMPLETE" = I have not completed all the challenges in a category

*ALL CODE HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MYSELF*
